                <h2>Atbash Cipher</h2>
                <p>The Atbash Cipher is a classical cipher where the letters of the alphabet are reversed. The first
                    letter becomes the last, the second becomes the second last, and so on. This simple substitution
                    cipher was originally used in the Hebrew script but can be applied to any alphabet. Despite its
                    simplicity, it provides an interesting twist on basic substitution techniques. <b>This technique
                        only encrypts and decrypts letters.</b></p>

            <li>
                <h2>Caesar Cipher</h2>
                <p>The Caesar Cipher is a simple and ancient substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is
                    shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. Named after Julius Caesar, who used it
                    in his private correspondence, this cipher is easy to understand and implement, making it a popular
                    choice for introducing the concepts of encryption. <b>This technique only encrypts and decrypts
                        letters.</b></p>

            <li>
                <h2>Playfair Cipher</h2>
                <p>The Playfair Cipher is a digraph substitution cipher that encrypts pairs of letters. Developed by
                    Charles Wheatstone and named after Lord Playfair, this cipher uses a 5x5 matrix of letters to encode
                    the plaintext. Each letter pair is substituted based on their positions in the matrix, providing a
                    more complex encryption than simple substitution ciphers. <b>This technique encrypts and decrypts
                        letters and numbers.</b></p>
                <button onclick="location.href='playfair.html'" class="btn btn-primary">Use Playfair Cipher</button>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Rail Fence Cipher</h2>
                <p>The Rail Fence Cipher is a transposition cipher that encrypts text by writing it in a zigzag pattern
                    across multiple lines, or "rails," and then reading it off line by line. The plaintext is arranged
                    diagonally across these rails, and the ciphertext is formed by concatenating characters from each
                    rail. This method rearranges the characters rather than substituting them, making it a simple yet
                    effective example of transposition encryption. <b>This technique encrypts and decrypts letters,
                        numbers, and special characters.</b></p>

            <li>
                <h2>Vigenère Cipher</h2>
                <p>The Vigenère Cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a simple form of
                    polyalphabetic substitution. It employs a series of Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a
                    keyword. Unlike the Caesar Cipher, the Vigenère Cipher uses a different shift for each letter in the
                    plaintext, offering a more secure encryption method that was once thought to be unbreakable. <b>This
                        technique only encrypts and decrypts letters.</b></p>
                <button onclick="location.href='vigenere.html'" class="btn btn-primary">Use Vigenère Cipher</button>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>XOR Cipher</h2>
                <p>The XOR Cipher is a simple symmetric encryption algorithm where each character in the plaintext is
                    XORed with a key to produce the ciphertext. This technique relies on the bitwise XOR operation,
                    which can be easily implemented in various programming languages. It serves as a fundamental example
                    of symmetric encryption and is useful for learning about basic encryption techniques and bitwise
                    operations. <b>This technique only encrypts and decrypts letters.</b></p>
